Student database using python programming language which stores data as both CSV and Binary.

I have developed this student database using python programming language.It stores details of students like Roll no.,Name,Attendance,Marks,Phone no..
The Data will be stored in csv as well as binary file.
There are many finctions which are made menu-driven.
